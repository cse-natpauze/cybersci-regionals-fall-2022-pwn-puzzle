At the following remote service is a "secure storage system"
you can connect to it with netcat at XXX.XXX.X.XXX:10001
There is a secret entry in its storage that's been deleted but that we need you to recover!
We've also acquired you the source code of the application, given to you as main.c so you can explore it locally. 
(The source code doesn't contain the secret key unfortunately!)
